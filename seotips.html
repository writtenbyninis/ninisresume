<img src="./assets/pushup.jpg" height="200" alt="pushup">

<p>Are you struggling with traffic since the early stages of your SEO project? You're not alone. I was, too. But that was before I realized that SEO isn't just about posting content online and waiting for traffic.

<p>Many SEO tips suggest putting certain keywords, meta titles, meta descriptions, and internal links in your articles. These are quite effective, but not the only factor to win SEO.
These strategies help us communicate better with search engines. </p>

<p>However, the actual consumers of our products - articles, are people after all. Therefore, our primary focus should be on serving them.
Based on my 5-year experience in SEO, I have summarized 7 SEO content strategies to help you achieve your SEO goals. Here's how.</p>

<h2>Be specific about your target audience</h2>
When designing an SEO content strategy at my previous company, we focused entirely on driving traffic. We kept publishing articles for everyone without understanding our target market.
Yes, we managed to get tons of traffic, but we attracted wrong demographics who wouldn't buy our products.

Don't be like us.

Identify your target audience before starting your SEO project. Consider factors like their gender, location, age, marital status, education, and income. Make sure that you throw the right page into the right demographic.
Align their profile with your product's consumers. Study your consumer profiles.

<h2>Set your objective</h2>
There are several metrics to measure SEO success; views (how many times your page is being seen), users (how many people visit your page), ranking (your page's rank on certain keywords in Google search results).
Each metrics have its significance.
Having many views is beneficial if you are getting revenue from site advertisements.
Generating large number of users is ideal if you want to sell products to new customers.
Ranking high on Google Search Results means you will likely be seen more by Google users. It elevates your branding.

Set your goals at the beginning of your SEO journey, then carefully choose the metrics that align with those goals.
<h2>Master your topic</h2>
After identifying your target audience, select a niche to reach them.
For instance, if you're selling insurance products, you could create articles about personal finance for middle-class or upper-middle-class individuals.
Break down the niche into subtopics like investment, saving, debt, or retirement plans. This is known as topic clustering.
Now that you have a niche and subtopics, you can start producing articles. Remember that Google values the E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) concept.
This means that articles written by expert writers with proficient mastery of the topic will be valued more. An expert writer signals that the information in the article is trustworthy.
<h2>Show actual cases and solutions, backed with data</h2>
What if you have no certified or well-known expert on the topic in your team? E-E-A-T concept can also be applied by delivering real-life cases and data in your articles.
For example, when you write an article about saving and investing, show the readers how you managed to save, let's say $1,000,000 in 5 years. Provide exact numbers and steps you took to achieve that goal.
When stating a personal finance theory, you could quote some financial advisor, investment manager, or successful investor. For example:
Warren Buffet said, "If you like spending six to eight hours per week working on investments, do it. If you don't, then dollar-cost average into index funds."
You can also help your readers count. To reach $1,000,000 in 5 years; break down the number into yearly, monthly, and daily goals.
Tell the reader how much they should save in a day to reach that number, or where should they invest to save less to achieve the same goal.

<h2>Give your reader direct answers</h2>
When Googling something, readers want a direct answer. They don't want to waste time on long-winded explanations.
How do we know what questions they are asking? You can get clues from:
<ol>
    <li>SEO tools like Ahrefs or Semrush</li>
    <li>Google Suggest (when you type a keyword on search engine, it will suggest some long-tail keywords)</li>
<li>Google People Also Asked</li>
</ol>

Google suggesting long-tail keywords (most searched topic by users)Let's say you want to write an article about investing tips. From Google Suggest alone, you can get several topic ideas.
<ul>
    <li>how to invest money</li>
    <li>how to invest in bitcoin</li>
    <li>how to invest in bitcoin</li>
    <li>how to invest in real estate</li>
    <li>how to invest in crypto</li>
    <li>how to invest in stock market</li>
</ul>

Make sure you give direct answers to questions above. If you have several points, use Headings to highlight your tips so readers can scan your article. Don't bore readers with long paragraphs.
Research your topic using the tools mentioned above, and ensure your articles address the questions your audience is asking.
<h2>An article can answer several questions</h2>
An article can rank for multiple keywords if it addresses more than one user's questions.
For example, in an article about "how to invest money" (general investing tips), you could also provide various investing instruments, like real estate, crypto, bitcoin, and stock market.
So, it's not impossible to rank for these keywords:
<ul>
    <li>how to invest in bitcoin</li>
    <li>how to invest in real estate</li>
    <li>how to invest in crypto</li>
    <li>how to invest in stock market</li>
</ul>
You can fit all within a single long article that provides comprehensive answers, right?
This is beneficial for your company as it generates more results with fewer resources.

<h2>Pick trending topics from social media or Google Trends</h2>
Want to rank fast? Actually, there's some low-hanging fruit you can pick: trending topics from social media. Why?
Less competition because the topic is new.
People are still searching about it, which drive traffic.

However, riding the wave of a viral topic usually only works in the short term, as interests typically fade within 1–2 days.

<p>SEO is about understanding and serving your audience. By being specific about your target audience, setting clear objectives, mastering your topic, and providing real and data-backed solutions, you can create content that not only ranks well on search engines but also resonates with your readers.
Remember to give direct answers to the questions your audience is asking and leverage trending topics to gain quick visibility.
Ultimately, the key to SEO success lies in balancing the needs of search engines with the expectations of your human audience.</p>
